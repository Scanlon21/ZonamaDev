      <h3>How do I enable the admin commands?</h3>
        <p>To enable these features in the client you will need to edit the user.cfg file in the c:\SWGEMU folder to add these 4 lines:</p>
          <p>[ClientGame]
          <p>0fd345d9 = true
          <p>[ClientUserInterface]
          <p>debugExamine=1
        <p>If  the user.cfg file doesnâ€™t exist, simply copy swgemu.cfg and rename it as user.cfg. Then, replace the contents of the new user.cfg with the contents of the table above.</p>
        <p>You might also need to add a line in swgemu.cfg to tell the client to use the new user.cfg file:</p>
          <p>.include "swgemu_login.cfg"
          <p>.include "swgemu_live.cfg"
          <p>.include "swgemu_preload.cfg"
          <p>.include "options.cfg"
          <p>.include "user.cfg" <-- THIS LINE MIGHT BE MISSING or Commented out
      <p>Once the config files are done, totally shut down your client (if running) and restart it.</p>
    <h3>How do I create an admin account?</h3>
      <p>In MySQL Workbench, go to Schemata--->swgemu--->accounts--->go to admin_level---> change 0 to 15--->Applychange--->Execute--->Then do build config again.</p>
